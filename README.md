On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die. At any time during a player’s turn, the player is faced with two decisions: • If the player rolls a 1, then the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent’s turn. • If the player rolls 2 through 6, then he or she can either: -- ROLL AGAIN or -- HOLD. At this point, the sum of all rolls is added to the player’s score, and it becomes the other player’s turn.
